# Week-1-Challenge-Jason-Hunter

Week-1-Challenge-Jason-Hunter is my attempt at the code refactoring for the Week 1 challenge. The challenges main aspect was accessibility. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.

## How I went about refactoring
After downloading the source to my local repository, I opened it an reviewed it using VS Code. I then created a repository in my GitHub subscription and uploaded my first commit from my machine. From there I used the following criteria supplied to work aganist, attempting to resolve each item.

* **Technical Acceptance Criteria**
>* Application's links all function correctly.
>* Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
> * Application's CSS file is properly commented.

* **Deployment**
>* Application deployed at live URL.
>* Application loads with no errors.
>* Application GitHub URL submitted.
>* GitHub repository that contains application code.

* **Application Quality**
>* Application resembles (at least 90%) screenshots provided in the Challenge instructions.

* **Repository Quality**
>* Repository has a unique name.
>* Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.
>* Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
>* Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.
>* Repository contains quality README file with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application.
